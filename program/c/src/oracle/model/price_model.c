 * order it swaps the root with the last element and then sifts down the root.
 *
 * The number of comparisions in average case is nlgn + O(1) and in worst case is
 * 1.5nlgn + O(n).
 *
 * There are a lot of (j-1) or (j+1) math in the code which can be optimized by
 * thinking of a as 1-based array. Fortunately, BPF compiler optimizes that for us.

 * This implementation optimizes the price_model_core function for minimal compute unit usage in BPF.
 *
 * In Solana, each BPF instruction costs 1 unit of compute and is much different than a native code
 * execution time. Here are some of the differences:
 * 1. There is no cache, so memory access is much more expensive.
 * 2. The instruction set is very minimal, and there are only 10 registers available.
 * 3. The BPF compiler is not very good at optimizing the code.
 * 4. The stack size is limited and having extra stack frame has high overhead.
 *
 * This implementation is chosen among other implementations such as merge-sort, quick-sort, and quick-select
 * because it is very fast, has small number of instructions, and has a very small memory footprint by being
 * in-place and is non-recursive and has a nlogn worst-case time complexity.
