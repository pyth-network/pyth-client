### pre-commit hooks
pre-commit is a tool that checks and fixes simple issues (formatting, ...) before each commit. You can install it by following [their website](https://pre-commit.com/). In order to enable checks for this repo run `pre-commit install` from command-line in the root of this repo.

The checks are also performed in the CI to ensure the code follows consistent formatting.
You might also need to install the nightly toolchain to run the formatting by running `rustup toolchain install nightly`.
